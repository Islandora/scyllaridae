When creating a new microservice, you need to decide what pattern your microservice will fall under

- [Create a derivate media from an existing media](/derivatives/events/)
    - Create a thumbnail JPG from a TIFF
    - Extract OCR text from a PDF or image
    - Generate an audio or video derivative
- [Index a Drupal entity into some other system](/index/events/)
    - Index Drupal node metadata in blazegraph
    - Index Drupal node metadata in fedora
- [Something more complex](/all/events/)
    - aggregating all children images of a paged content item into a single PDF
    - Adding a PDF coverpage to scholarly works, and the coverpage includes metadata from the parent node
