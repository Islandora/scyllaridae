## Attribution

This is spiritually a fork of the php/symfony implementation at [Islandora/Crayfish](https://github.com/Islandora/crayfish). The implementation of Crayfish was then generalized here to allow new microservices to just define a Dockerfile to install the proper binary/dependencies and a YML spec to execute the binary depending on the mimetype being processed. Hence the name of this service. [From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slipper_lobster):

> Slipper lobsters are a family (Scyllaridae) of about 90 species of achelate crustaceans
