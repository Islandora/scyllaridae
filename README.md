# scyllaridae

Any microservice that takes stdin as input and returns a stream to stdout can use scyllaridae to facilitate its execution.


## Attribution

This is spiritually a fork of the php/symfony implementation at https://github.com/Islandora/crayfish, generalized so new microservices that just need the command arguments set properly on a binary on disk can quickly spin up a new microservice.
